# Daily Reports System — Frontend

This is a minimal React + Vite frontend scaffold for "Lalan rubbers Pvt LTD". It expects the backend API at `VITE_API_BASE` or `http://localhost:5000/api`.

Branding / Logo
- Place your company logo file at `frontend/public/logo.png`. The app will load `/logo.png` automatically and show it in the navbar. If the file is missing the site name will still be shown.

Install and run:

1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
